        <h1>Installation Test - Instructions</h1>                     
        <p>Connect to the ESP via AP method (AP = SpotifyRemoteAP) on your phone or PC, choose your network and enter password to configure WiFi</p>
        <p>Once configured and device restarts, connect to Https://192.168.1.125/Dev (this message should also display on device as well)</p>
        <p>
          If you have not done so, head over to dev.spotify.com and create an account.  
          Add a new app and call it what you want.  
          This will generate you a client id and client secret.  
          For the callback enter in https://192.168.1.125/callback <br />
          NOTE: Your cyd will display its local IP on the screen once you connect, if it is different from the IP above, enter in this ip for the callback URL instead <br />
          Enter in the generated client id + secret in the Dev credentials page to save them within the app.
        </p>
        
        <p>Enter in the client id and secret from your Spotify Dev Account and save them with the button</p>
        <p>You should be redirected to the spotify login page, click the link to retrieve your access token and allow the remote to start working on your device</p>
        <p>If you do not have a device currently playing music, press play on the pc app or web player to activate it.  A message SHOULD display to tell you this as well.</p>
        <p>Once an active device has been set you can use now use your CYD to control Spotify!  The app will take care of token refreshing for you, but if you turn off the device for more than hour you may have to visit Https://192.168.1.125 again to login for a new access token</p>
